A severe dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The mission is scrubbed, but as the crew evacuates, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm. The telemetry from his suit's biomonitor is damaged and Watney is wrongly presumed dead. With the MAV on the verge of toppling, the surviving crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the Hermes.",
